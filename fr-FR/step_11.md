## Using a light-dependent resistor

### Analogue inputs

In the world of electrical engineering, there are two type of input and output (I/O): analogue and digital. Digital I/O is fairly easy to understand; it's either *on* or *off*, *1* or *0*.

When talking about voltages and the Raspberry Pi, any input that is approximately below 1.8V is considered *off* and anything above 1.8V is considered *on*. For output, 0V is off and 3.3V is on.

Analogue I/O is a little trickier. With an analogue input, we can have a range of voltages from 0V up to 3.3V, and the Raspberry Pi is unable to detect exactly what that voltage is.

How, then, can we use a Raspberry Pi to determine the value of an analogue input, if it can only tell when the voltage to a GPIO pin goes above 1.8V?

### Using a capacitor for analogue inputs

Capacitors are electrical components that store charge.

When current is fed into a capacitor, it will begin to store charge. The voltage across the capacitor will start off low, and increase as the charge builds up.

By putting a resistor in series with the capacitor, you can slow the speed at which it charges. With a high resistance, the capacitor will charge slowly, whereas a low resistance will let it charge quickly.

If you time how long it takes the capacitor's voltage to get over 1.8V (or be *on*), you can work out the resistance of the component in series with it.

Many, but not all, capacitors are polarised which means they have a positive and a negative leg. In this case, the negative leg is shorter and should be marked with a '-' symbol.

### Light-dependent resistors

An LDR (sometimes called a photocell) is a special type of resistor.

When light hits the LDR, its resistance is very low, but when it's in the dark its resistance is very high.

By placing a capacitor in series with an LDR, the capacitor will charge at different speeds depending on whether it's light or dark.

### Creating a light-sensing circuit

+  Place an LDR into your breadboard, as shown below:

+  Now place a capacitor in series with the LDR. As the capacitor is a polar component, you must make sure the positive, long leg is on the same track as the LDR leg.

+  Finally, add jumper leads to connect the two components to your Raspberry Pi.

### Coding a light sensor

Luckily, most of the complicated code you would have to write to detect the light levels received by the LDR has been abstracted away by the `gpiozero` library. This library will handle the timing of the capacitor's charging and discharging for you.

Use the following code to set up the light sensor:

```python
  from gpiozero import LightSensor, Buzzer

  ldr = LightSensor(4)  # alter if using a different pin
  while True:
      print(ldr.value)

```

Run this code, then cover the LDR with your hand and watch the value change. Try shining a strong light onto the LDR.
